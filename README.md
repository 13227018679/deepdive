# DimmWitted [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HazyResearch/sampler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HazyResearch/sampler)

## How fast is DimmWitted?

  - On Amazon EC2's FREE MACHINE (512M memory, 1 core). We can sample 3.6M variables/seconds.
  - On a 2-node Amazon EC2 machine, sampling 7 billion random variables, each of which has 10 features, takes 3 minutes. This means we can run inference for all living human beings on this planet with $15 (100 samples!)
  - On Macbook, DimmWitted runs 10x faster than DeepDive's default sampler.

## Usage

See: the [DimmWitted sampler page in DeepDive's documentation](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/basics/sampler.html).

The binary format for DimmWitted's input is specified in [DeepDive's factor graph schema reference](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/doc/advanced/factor_graph_schema.html).

## Installation

First, install dependencies

    make dep

Then

    make

This will use whatever in you $(CXX) variable to compile. We assume that you have > g++4.7.2 or clang++-4.2. To specify a compiler to use, type in something like

    CXX=/dfs/rulk/0/czhang/software/gcc/bin/g++ make

On MacOS, `CXX=/opt/local/bin/clang++ make`

To test, run

    make test

On MacOS, you can use MacPorts to install clang.

    port select --list clang
    sudo port install clang-3.7
    sudo port select --set clang mp-clang-3.7 

You can then compile using

    CXX=/opt/local/bin/clang++ make

## Development

* Run `make -j` to build.
* Run `make -j test` to test.
* Follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
* Travis CI tests will error unless you run `make format` before git commits.
* Tests are written with [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).
* Command-line parsing is done with [TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net).
* NUMA control is done with [libnuma](http://oss.sgi.com/projects/libnuma/).
