# How DeepDive applications are typically developed

All successful DeepDive applications that achieve high quality are never developed in a single shot;
A basic version is first written that gives relatively poor result, then it is **improved iteratively** through a series of *error analysis* and debugging.
DeepDive provides a suite of tools that aim to keep each development iteration as quick and easy as possible.


## 1. Write

First of all, the user has to write in DDlog a schema that describes the input data as well as the data to be produced, along with how they should be processed and transformed.
Normal derivation rules as well as *user-defined functions* (UDFs) written in Python or any other language can be used for defining the data processing parts.
Then, using the processed data, a statistical inference model describing a set of random variables and their correlations can be defined also in DDlog to specify what kind of predictions are to be made by the system.

How to write each of these parts [in a DeepDive application](deepdiveapp.md) is described in the following pages:

- [Defining data flow in DDlog](writing-dataflow-ddlog.md)
- [Writing user-defined functions in Python](writing-udf-python.md)
- [Specifying a statistical model in DDlog](writing-model-ddlog.md)


## 2. Run

As soon as any new piece of the DeepDive application is written, the user can compile and run it incrementally.
For example, after declaring the schema for the input text corpus, the actual data can be loaded into the database and queried.
As more rules that transform the base input data or derived data are written, they can be executed incrementally.
The statistical inference model can be constructed from the data according to what's specified in DDlog, and its parameters can be learned or reused to make predictions with their marginal probabilities.

DeepDive provides a suite of commands and conventions to carry out these operations, which are documented in the following pages:

- [Compiling a DeepDive application](ops-compiling.md)
- [Managing input data and data products](ops-data.md)
- [Controlling execution of data processing](ops-execution.md)
- [Learning and inference with the statistical model](ops-model.md)


## 3. Evaluate & Debug

Based on our observation of [several successful DeepDive applications](showcase/apps.md), we can say that the more rapid the user moves through the development cycle, the more quick she acheives high-quality.
By evaluating the predictions made by the system through formal error analysis supported by interactive tools, the user can identify the most common mode of errors after each iteration.
Such information enables the user to focus on fixing the mistakes that caused such class of errors, instead of spending her time poorly on some corners that only give marginal improvement.

DeepDive provides a suite of tools and guides to accelerate the development process, which are documented in the following pages:

- [Debugging UDFs](debugging-udf.md)
- [Labeling data products](labeling.md)
- [Browsing data](browsing.md)
- [Monitoring descriptive statistics of data](dashboard.md)
- [Calibration](calibration.md)
- [Generating negative examples](generating_negative_examples.md)
