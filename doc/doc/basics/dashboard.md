# Dashboard

This document describes Dashboard, which serves as an interface for viewing and analyzing the results of your DeepDive application runs.

Dashboard provides built-in [report templates](#report-templates) (as well the ability to [create your own templates](#custom-report-templates)) which generate visual reports for the data resulting from your DeepDive application run. Reports are generated by running Dashboard [snapshots](#snapshots), which capture and retain the data relevant for displaying the reports. [Snapshot configurations](#configuring-snapshots) can be created to specify which reports should be generated for a particular Dashboard snapshot. 

Once a snapshot has been run, you will be able to view the resulting reports. Additionally, you can run [tasks](#tasks) on values from a report for further analysis.

To analyze the results of your DeepDive application runs over time, you can track specified *report values* and view a visual representation of how they have changed over time using [Trends](#trends).

## Snapshots

A Snapshot captures all of the data required to generate the reports associated with its snapshot configuration. Prior to running a snapshot, you must specify its snapshot configuration.

### Configuring Snapshots

A snapshot configuration consists of a list of report templates and the parameter values for each report template. Snapshot configurations are made from the *Run Snapshot* tab.

A default snapshot configuration is included with Dashbaord. You may modify this configuration or create your own by clicking the "Add Configuration" button. You may also copy the contents of an existing configuration to a new configuration using the "Copy Configuration" button from an existing configuration.

To add a report template to the snapshot configuration, click the "Add Template" button and select the report template of interest from the dropdown menu. You can add additional report templates to the configuration using these same steps. If you want to remove a template from the snapshot configuration, click the red "X" next to the report template dropdown.

When a report template is selected, the corresponding parameters for that template will appear directly below. You should fill in these parameters with the values relevant to your interests and DeepDive application structure. Some parameters may already be filled in if a default value was specified in the report template. For built-in report templates, you can refer to the parameter's "Description" field in the report template configuration for a description of what value the parameter should take.

Once you have finished adding the report templates and their corresponding parameter values which comprise the snapshot configuration, you should save the configuraiton by clicking the "Update Configuration" button.

A configuration can be deleted by clicking the "Delete Configuration" button from an existing configuration.

### Running Snapshots

To run a snapshot, first load its snapshot configuration by selecting the snapshot name from the dropdown on the *Run Snapshots* page. This will show you the list of report templates and correspdoning parameter values which will be used to create the snapshot.

Click the "Run Snapshot" button at the bottom of the snapshot configuration to run the snapshot.

## Viewing Reports

Once a snapshot has been made, the reports corresponding to the report templates used in the snapshot configuration will be available from the "View Snapshots" tab.

The name of the snapshot corresponds to the date the snapshot was made, followed by the run number for that day. For example, snapshot "20150714-5" was run on July 14, 2015, and was the fifth snapshot run that day.

To view the reports associated with a snapshot, click on the snapshot name. On the page for that individual snapshot, the reports are shown in a navigation menu on the left. Any nested reports are displayed hierarchically - you can use the small arrow to the left of the report names to collapse and expand the reports nested beneath it. 

To view a report, click the report's name from the navigation menu. The report will display a data table or chart(s), depending on how the report template was written.

At the top right of the report are three buttons:
* Details: View the raw settings used to generate the report.
* Template: Go to the report template for this report.
* Tasks: Opens the interface for running tasks on this report. See the [tasks documentation](#tasks).
